<p>In this project we will perform and principal components analysis on different vegetables and their nutrient content. Data for this project was obtained from the USDA Food Data Central which provides data on the nutrient content of different foods. This dataset was retrieved from <a href="https://fdc.nal.usda.gov/index.html" class="uri">https://fdc.nal.usda.gov/index.html</a></p>

<h4>Key Takeways of the Principal Components Analysis</h4>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Certain vegetables are high in nutrients such as folate niacin, riboflavin, and thiamin while other veggies are higher in calories, vitamin B6, fiber, sugar, vitamins A, C, and E.</li>
<li>This begs the assertion that there are groups of vegetables that are high in these two categories of nutrients.</li>
<li>These nutrients account for over 50% of the variance between different vegetables.</li>
</ol>
